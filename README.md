### Hi, I'm Becky ðŸ‘‹

Data is a mid-career shift for me. I had a test engineering position which introduced me to larger data sets and EDL, and it was love at first sight. What we learn from Big Data is limited only by what we can dream up to ask.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on processing Top Passwords of 2021.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python! I'm getting ready to jump into Georgia Tech's Analytics Modeling in January as I dive into their OMSA (masters) program.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Becky.Freckleton at Gmail
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her

Thanks for dropping by!
