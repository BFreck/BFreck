### Hi, I'm Becky ðŸ‘‹

Data is a mid-career shift for me. I had a test engineering position which introduced me to larger data sets and EDL, and it was love at first sight. 

What we learn from Big Data is limited only by what we can dream up to ask. I feel like a kid in a candy store at times!

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python! 
      - I'm taking Georgia Tech's Computing for Data Analysis (CSE 6040) in Spring 2023 as I prep for their OMSA (masters) program.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Becky.Freckleton at Gmail

Thanks for dropping by!
